# Split Bullet: Deathmatch
This repository is the source for ``Split Bullet: Deathmatch``'s Workshop addon.

Split Bullet: Deathmatch is a multi-player PvP mode for Split Bullet, a 2.5-dimensional shooter. Customize your arsenal and play different game types against other players.

This should be cloned into an addon folder, usually ``addons/splitbullet_deathmatch/`` works best when uploading with GMAD to the Workshop.
